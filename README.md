## How To Use
> RecipeBuddy requires Java 17 or newer. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) if you don't already have it. (Linux users just need to install the package "openjdk-17-jre-headless")

To set up RecipeBuddy, just download the [latest release](https://github.com/crazyrecipes/RecipeBuddy/releases) and extract the .zip. The result should look something like this:
```
/ RecipeBuddy_v1.0.0
  / RecipeBuddy.jar
  / data
    / ...
```
Double-click the .jar to run the app. A terminal should pop up with some log events showing the app has started up. (you can also run the .jar with the following command from a terminal: "java -jar RecipeBuddy.jar").

Once the app has started, just open a browser to "http://localhost:8080", and you should see a screen letting you know you're in the right place.
